# AI Agents

Welcome to the AI Agents module! This comprehensive module will teach you how to build autonomous AI agents with advanced reasoning and execution capabilities.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you'll learn about:

- Designing robust agent architectures
- Integrating tools and external systems
- Implementing LangChain for agent development
- Building autonomous systems

## Module Structure

1. **Agent Architecture**: Master agent design patterns and planning systems
2. **Tool Integration**: Learn to integrate and manage external tools
3. **LangChain**: Implement agents using the LangChain framework
4. **Autonomous Systems**: Build complete autonomous AI systems

Each section builds upon the previous one, helping you create sophisticated AI agents.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Completed all previous modules
- Advanced JavaScript/TypeScript experience
- Strong system design background
- Understanding of AI concepts

## Getting Started

Select a section from the sidebar to begin your journey into AI agent development. We recommend following the sections in order, as each builds upon the concepts introduced in the previous ones.

- Tool integration
- Custom tools
- Deployment patterns

### 4. Autonomous Systems

- Task planning
- Goal setting
- Progress monitoring
- Self-correction
- Resource management
- Safety constraints

## Building Agents

You'll create several types of agents:

- Research assistant
- Code generation agent
- Data analysis agent
- Task automation agent
- Multi-agent systems

### Advanced Features

- Long-term memory
- Tool discovery
- Learning from feedback
- Performance optimization
- Error recovery
- Safety protocols

## Project Work

Build a complete agent system:

- Agent framework setup
- Tool integration
- Memory systems
- Planning module
- Execution engine
- Monitoring dashboard

Let's create intelligent AI agents that can solve complex tasks!
