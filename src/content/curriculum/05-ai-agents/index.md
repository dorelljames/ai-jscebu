# AI Agents

Learn to create autonomous AI agents that can reason, plan, and execute tasks independently using advanced AI capabilities.

## Module Overview

### 1. Agent Architecture

- Agent design patterns
- Planning systems
- Memory management
- Decision making
- Task decomposition
- Execution monitoring

### 2. Tool Integration

- Tool description
- Tool validation
- Error recovery
- Tool chaining
- Result verification
- Safety measures

### 3. LangChain

- LangChain basics
- Chains and agents
- Memory types
- Tool integration
- Custom tools
- Deployment patterns

### 4. Autonomous Systems

- Task planning
- Goal setting
- Progress monitoring
- Self-correction
- Resource management
- Safety constraints

## Building Agents

You'll create several types of agents:
