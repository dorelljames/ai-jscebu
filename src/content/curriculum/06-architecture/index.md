# Architecture

Welcome to the Architecture module! This comprehensive module will teach you how to design and implement scalable AI systems that integrate seamlessly with existing applications.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you'll learn about:

- Designing scalable AI system architectures
- Implementing ethical AI practices and privacy measures
- Creating effective integration patterns
- Following industry best practices

## Module Structure

1. **System Design**: Master scalable AI architecture patterns
2. **Ethics & Privacy**: Learn responsible AI development practices
3. **Integration Patterns**: Implement effective system integration strategies
4. **Best Practices**: Apply industry-standard development practices

Each section builds upon the previous one, helping you create robust AI systems.
