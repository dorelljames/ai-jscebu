# AI & LLM Basics

## Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data. They can understand and generate human-like text, making them powerful tools for various applications.

## How AI Models Work

AI models process input data through complex neural networks, learning patterns and relationships to generate meaningful outputs. Understanding their basic principles helps in effectively utilizing them in your applications.

## Types of AI Models and Their Applications

Different types of AI models serve various purposes:

- Generative Models (like GPT)
- Classification Models
- Embedding Models
- Fine-tuned Models

## Key AI Terminology and Concepts

- Tokens and Tokenization
- Prompt Engineering
- Temperature and Top-p
- Context Window
- Model Parameters
- Training and Fine-tuning
