# RAG Systems

Welcome to the RAG Systems module! This comprehensive module will teach you how to build AI applications with Retrieval-Augmented Generation capabilities.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you'll learn about:

- Understanding vector databases and embeddings
- Implementing similarity search algorithms
- Managing knowledge bases effectively
- Building RAG-powered applications

## Module Structure

1. **Vector Databases**: Master vector embeddings and database management
2. **Similarity Search**: Learn efficient search algorithms and optimization
3. **Embeddings**: Understand text embedding models and processing
4. **Knowledge Integration**: Build applications with RAG capabilities

Each section builds upon the previous one, helping you create powerful RAG-enabled applications.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Completed the AI Foundations module
- Completed the AI-Powered Tools module
- Strong understanding of database concepts
- Experience with vector operations

## Getting Started

Select a section from the sidebar to begin your journey into RAG systems. We recommend following the sections in order, as each builds upon the concepts introduced in the previous ones.

### 4. Knowledge Bases
