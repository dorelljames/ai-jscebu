      # Understanding Prompt Components

      A well-structured prompt is essential for getting the best results from AI models. Let's break down the key components:

      ## Role and Context Setting
      - Define who the AI should act as
      - Provide relevant background information
      - Set the scope of the interaction

      ## Task Specification
      - Clear and specific instructions
      - Expected outcomes
      - Step-by-step breakdown when needed

      ## Output Formatting
      - Desired format (JSON, markdown, etc.)
      - Structure requirements
      - Examples of expected output

      ## Constraints and Guidelines
      - Limitations and boundaries
      - Quality criteria
      - Error handling preferences

      # Chain-of-thought Prompting

      Chain-of-thought prompting is a powerful technique that helps AI models break down complex problems into manageable steps.

      ## Breaking Down Complex Tasks
      - Identify the main components
      - Create logical sequences
      - Build dependencies between steps

      ## Step-by-step Reasoning
      - Explicit thinking process
      - Intermediate calculations
      - Decision points and branches

      ## Intermediate Steps in Prompts
      - Show working process
      - Validate assumptions
      - Track progress

      ## Verification and Validation
      - Check intermediate results
      - Confirm logical flow
      - Ensure accuracy of final output
